                        <h2>The Major Titans: Uranides & Iapetionides</h2>
                        <h3>Read time: 10 minutes</h3>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>The Titans were the dieities in Greek Mythlogy that preceded the Olympians. They were the children of the Primordial deities, Uranus (heaven) and Gaea (earth). The most important of the Titan gods were the twelve Uranides (Cronus, Oceanus, Iapetus, Hyperion, Crius, Coeus, Rhea, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Themis and Mnemosyne) and the four Iapetionides (Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius). </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            CRONUS
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Cronus was the youngest son of Uranus and Gaea, the leader of the first generation of Titans, and, for a brief period, the ruler of all gods and men. He successfully led the rebellion against his father, but soon grew as tyrnncial as him, imprisoning both the Cyclops and the Hecatoncheires, and swallowing all of his children, save the last son; eventually, this child - Zeus - would be the one to overthrow him and lock him away in Tartarus, the deep abyss in the underworld where the wicked recieved their divine punishment. </p>
                        
                        <blockquote>
                            RHEA
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Rhea, hailed as a mother goddess, was the older sister of Cronus, who was also her consort. When he learnt that he was destined to be overthrown by one of his children, like his father before him, he swallowed all the children Rhea bore as soon as they were born. When Rhea had her sixth and final child, Zeus, she spirited him away and hid him in Crete, giving Cronus a rock to swallow instead, thus saving her youngest son who would go on to challenge his father's rule and rescue the rest of his siblings. Following Zeus's defeat of Cronus and the rise of the Olympian gods into power, Rhea withdraws from her role as the queen of the gods to become a supporting figure on Mount Olympus.  </p>

                        <blockquote>THEMIS</blockquote>
                        <p>Themis is the goddess and personification of justice, divine order, law and custom. The second wife of the Olympian God, Zeus, she is asscociated with oracles and prophecies, including the Oracle of Delphi. Her symbol is the Scales of Justice.</p>

                        <blockquote>THEIA</blockquote>
                        <p>Theia is the goddess of sight and vision, and by extension the goddess who endowed gold, silver and gems with their intrinsic value. Her brother-consort is Hyperion, Titan and god of the sun, and together they are the parents of Helios (the Sun), Selene (the Moon) and Eos (the Dawn).</p>

                        <Blockquote> OCEANUS</Blockquote>
                        <p>Oceanus was the father of the river gods and the Oceanids with his sister, Tethys, as well as being the great river which encircled the entire world. </p>
